# NeCRUD

A CRUD server for NeDB.

This is a webserver with authentication that provides CRUD operations on a collection
of NeDB databases.


# getting started

```shell
> git clone https://github.com/bnielsen1965/necrud
> cd necrud
> npm install
> node index.js
```

This will bring up a server with the default settings using the provided self signed
certificate. Open a web browser to the server running on the default port, I.E.

http://localhost:8880/


# configuration

The config directory contains discrete configuration files for each functional aspect
of the application.


## authentication

The authentication configuration contains router settings that control which routes
are allowed by anyone, which routes are completely disallowed, and which routes
that are used for the authentication service.

**NOTE:** The authentication configuration requires the users configuration, the
json web token configuration, and the hash configuration.


## users

The users configuration is a simple array of users that can authenticate with the
application. The password in the user element must be a hash generated by the api
hash function or blank for an empty password.


## jwt

The jwt configuration contains the JSON web token settings.


## hash

The hash configuration contains the settings for hashing of user passwords.


## webserver

The webserver settings define the HTTP and HTTPS ports to use as well as paths to
the HTTPS key and certificate files.

**NOTE:** The application includes a sample self signed certificate in the certs directory.


## socketserver

The socket server configuration requires the jwt settings so websocket connections
can be authorized based on the provided JSON web token.


# API

The lib files include an example webapi module for REST API calls and a socketapi
module for WebSocket API calls.
